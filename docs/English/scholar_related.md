## amplitude and magnitude
> [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude): the greatest distance that a wave, especially a sound or radio wave vibrates (moves up and down)  
> [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)) 


## crystal potential
In quantum mechanics, [pariticle in one-dimensional lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_one-dimensional_lattice) is a problem that occurs in the model of a periodic crystal lattice. The potential is caused by ions in the periodic structure of the crystal creating an **electromagnetic field** so electrons are subject to a regular potential inside the lattice.
